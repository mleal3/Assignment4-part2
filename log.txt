I do not have much of a log this week.  I do not understand the 
material at all.  I do not know what steps to take at this time
with CS290 so I will work through my options this week and make a 
decision moving forward.  I watched the lectures and read the
material but this is a very hard class, in my opinion.  Thank you.
